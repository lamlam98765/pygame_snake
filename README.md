# SNAKE GAME

#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/1nDtVpsRTaQ
#### Description: A vanilla snake game with three levels for CS50â€™s final project.

## Introduction: 
#### How to start: 

On the terminal: ```python the/path/to/file/project.py```

The terminal will ask you your name, the level you want to play, and if you're ready, the game will start.

#### Game design:
- Control: four arrow keys.
- Level: there are 3 levels easy, medium and hard corresponding to the speed of snake.
- As any other game, the apple will appear randomly, every time the snake eats 1 apple, it will score one more and the body will be longer.
- You lose when snake bite itself or head into the wall.
- Game will automatically close after LOSS.

#### Files:
- `project.py`: main script.
- `Graphics`: contains the graphics using in this game.
- `Sound`: contains the sound for the game.

## What I learned:
- First time I got in touch with `pygame` module, learning basic approach and tactics. And I have fun with this project.

- How to define and break down game problem into smaller chunk of elements and actions, how to flexibly create, update and solve the problems.

- How OOP is so good at encapsulating objects, it allows me to tear down, build layers independently and organize code efficiently.

- How to think to mimic the basic movements of game and apply vector thinking to it.

## My source:

I want to send my gratitude to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFvqStqPCRU) pygame tutorials on YouTube. It shows me a clear thinking process and provides elegant solution.
